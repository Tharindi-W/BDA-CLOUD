HealthSync, developed for MediTrack, streamlines patient data management and appointment tracking, enabling healthcare providers to efficiently access and update health records.
Microservices

We are implementing 4 microservices to efficiently handle data in this solution as,
	Appointment Scheduling Service
	Notification Service
	Patient Records Service
	Analytics and Aggregation Service
 
Appointment Scheduling Service

The Appointment Scheduling Service manages the core functionality of scheduling and maintaining appointments between patients and doctors. It interacts with the Appointments collection in MongoDB to store and update information such as the patient's name, doctor’s name, appointment date, time, and reason for the visit.When a new appointment is scheduled, the service validates the incoming data for completeness and then saves it into the database. Upon successful insertion, it communicates with the Notification Service to send confirmation messages to patients, ensuring a seamless and connected experience. Key functionalities include,
	Adding Appointments: Ensures accurate booking details are saved in the database.
	Updating and Deleting Appointments: Facilitates rescheduling or cancellation of appointments.
	Fetching Appointments: Provides users access to their booking history.
The service is designed to be robust and scalable, ensuring it meets the high demand of managing large volumes of appointment data efficiently.

Notification Service

The Notification Service complements the Appointment Scheduling Service by handling all patient communication related to appointments. This includes sending notifications about newly scheduled appointments and reminders for upcoming ones.
The service receives data from the Appointment Scheduling Service, processes it to generate personalized messages, and then simulates delivery through logs (e.g., SMS or email notifications). It also queries the Appointments collection directly to identify upcoming appointments and send timely reminders. Key functionalities include,
	Scheduled Notifications: Informs patients about their scheduled appointments.
	Reminders: Sends reminders one day prior to appointments, ensuring patients do not miss their bookings.
	Error Handling: Manages incomplete or faulty data with appropriate error messages.
The Notification Service adds value by ensuring patients are always informed about their healthcare schedules, improving reliability and trust in the system.

Patient Records Service

The Patient Records Service is responsible for managing patient-related data such as demographics, medical history, prescriptions, and lab results. It stores data in the Patients collection and provides an interface to add, update, or delete records.
This service is critical for maintaining up-to-date patient information, which can be referenced by other microservices to provide personalized care and insights. For instance, doctors can access past medical history when scheduling follow-ups or prescribing medications. Key functionalities include,
	Adding New Patients: Collects comprehensive patient details and saves them securely.
	Updating Patient Information: Ensures records remain accurate as patient conditions or demographics change.
	Deleting Patient Records: Allows for proper data management and compliance with privacy regulations.
This service ensures data integrity and acts as a single source of truth for patient information across the system.

Analytics and Aggregation Service

The Analytics and Aggregation Service provides insightful reporting and data analysis based on the information stored by other microservices. It performs scheduled jobs and uses MongoDB aggregation pipelines to derive actionable insights, which help improve healthcare operations and identify trends. Key functionalities include,
	Number of Appointments per Doctor:
A_d=Count (appoinments per doctor )
	Frequency of Appointments Over Time:
A_t=Count (appoinments per date )
	Common Symptoms and Conditions by Specialty:
Groups medical conditions recorded during appointments by the specialty of the attending doctor.
	Average Appointments per Patient:
〖Avg〗_p=  (∑▒〖appointments per patient〗)/(total number of patients)
These analytical reports enable hospitals and clinics to make data-driven decisions, optimize their services, and enhance patient outcomes.
